**Tip:** You can use the preview tab at the top to preview the article!


#### IMPORTANT: Mandatory fields

There are some mandatory fields you need to fill for the article to work:

First, you need to set a file name. Choose a descriptive name, words separated by `-` (no spaces). **The file must end with .md!**

Second, you need to set some basic article information at the top, the layout is always the same (including dashes):

```
---
title: <Title of your article>    # Title of your article
author: <your name>               # Your name
steamId: <your steam ID>          # (Optional) your steam ID to link to your steam profile
date: <date>                      # The date of writing
category: <category>              # One of: Scripting/User Interface/Assets/Beginners/Other
---
```

The category must be one of the following (exact capitalization!):

Category | Description 
--- | ---
Scripting | Related to Lua/KV 
User Interface | Related to Panorama 
Assets | Maps / Modelling / Particles 
Beginners | Tutorials meant as beginner guides 
Other | Everything not covered by the above 4 categories 

The steam ID field is optional. If you fill it in we will automatically generate a link to your steam profile at the top of the article.

### Submit your article for review

Once you're done you just need to add a very short description on the tutorial you just made at the bottom of the page. This will show up in the change history of the website. Once you are done hit the green 'Propose new file' button.
