<p>Many people probably have the idea of using custom models into the map but having a hard time with importing models into the engine, importing animation for the models, importing texture for the model, creating up your hero without cosmetic problem, and especially, doing this with .mdx format which is originally from Warcraft 3 since many people seems to want to port maps from warcraft 3 to source 2. Here is the tutorial on how to do so.</p>
<p>This tutorial will mainly focus on importing .mdx to source 2 engine for hero's use. But the steps are also usable with other models, units, and extensions as well if it has base model and animation ready. If you have any suggestion, question or improvement to this tutorial, do not hesitate send me a message or leave a comment.</p>
