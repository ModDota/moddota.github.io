I have created a tutorial on making a simple custom ability here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wDoRXgrjBY

I will be making more tutorials on various aspects of Source 2 mapping, which I will most likely post here, on /r/dota2modding, and at liquiddota.com. Feel free to comment or request particular topics to cover in future videos!
